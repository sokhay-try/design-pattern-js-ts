    <h1>Adapter Design Pattern</h1>
    <p>
        Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.

        The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.
