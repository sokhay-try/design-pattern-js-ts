    <h1>Factory Design Pattern</h1>
    <p>
        The factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. This makes the code more flexible and reusable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Factory method act as an actual factory. It creates our products which we request but we donâ€™t need to aware of how they are created.
