    <h1>Builder Design Pattern</h1>
    <p>
        The builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. This makes it easier to create different variations of the complex object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usage examples: The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in TypeScript world. Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.
        Identification: The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. Builder methods often support chaining (for example, someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).
