    <h1>Observer Design Pattern</h1>
    <p>
        The Observer pattern is a design pattern that allows objects to be notified of changes to other objects. It is a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any changes in state.
